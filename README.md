## ‚ñ∫ About The Project

Citeio is a full-stack application designed to ingest, analyze, and index media content. It tackles the problem of "information overload" in video and podcasts by automatically breaking down long-form content into distinct topics, summarizing them, and making the entire library semantically searchable. This allows users to find the exact moment a topic is discussed without scrubbing through hours of footage.

<br />

## ‚ñ∫ Core Features

* **üéôÔ∏è Automated Media Ingestion & Transcription:**
    * Downloads media from external sources (e.g., YouTube).
    * Standardizes content to an optimal audio format.
    * Generates a detailed, time-coded transcript.

* **üß† AI-Powered Content Analysis:**
    * Uses advanced language models to identify and extract distinct thematic topics.
    * Generates concise summaries for both the entire media file and each individual topic.

* **üîç Powerful Semantic Search:**
    * Generates vector embeddings for all content, capturing its semantic meaning.
    * Allows users to search based on concepts and ideas, not just keywords, and get back precise, timestamped results.

* **‚öôÔ∏è RESTful API:**
    * Exposes all functionality through a comprehensive API, allowing for easy integration with other services or client applications.

<br />

## ‚ñ∫ Architecture & Workflow

The application follows a sophisticated, automated pipeline from media ingestion to final output. The architecture is designed for scalability and efficient processing.

    subgraph "Ingestion Pipeline"
        A[User Submits URL] --> B{API Ingest};
        B --> C((Task Queue));
        C --> D(Download & Transcribe);
        D --> E{AI Analysis};
    end

    subgraph "Data Storage"
        E --> F[Topics/Summaries];
        E --> G[Vector Embeddings];
        F --> H[(PostgreSQL DB)];
        G --> I[(Vector DB)];
    end

    subgraph "Retrieval"
        J[User Searches] --> K{API Query};
        K --> H;
        K --> I;
    end
