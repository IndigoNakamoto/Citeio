## ‚ñ∫ About The Project

Citeio is a full-stack application designed to ingest, analyze, and index media content. It tackles the problem of "information overload" in video and podcasts by automatically breaking down long-form content into distinct topics, summarizing them, and making the entire library semantically searchable. This allows users to find the exact moment a topic is discussed without scrubbing through hours of footage.

<br />

## ‚ñ∫ Core Features

- **üéôÔ∏è Automated Media Ingestion & Transcription:**

  - Downloads media from external sources (e.g., YouTube).
  - Standardizes content to an optimal audio format.
  - Generates a detailed, time-coded transcript.

- **üß† AI-Powered Content Analysis:**

  - Uses advanced language models to identify and extract distinct thematic topics.
  - Generates concise summaries for both the entire media file and each individual topic.

- **üîç Powerful Semantic Search:**

  - Generates vector embeddings for all content, capturing its semantic meaning.
  - Allows users to search based on concepts and ideas, not just keywords, and get back precise, timestamped results.

- **‚öôÔ∏è RESTful API:**
  - Exposes all functionality through a comprehensive API, allowing for easy integration with other services or client applications.

<br />

## ‚ñ∫ Architecture & Workflow

The application follows a sophisticated, automated pipeline from media ingestion to final output. The architecture is designed for scalability and efficient processing.
