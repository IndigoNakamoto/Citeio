## The Problem: Lost Knowledge in Long-Form Content

Valuable insights are buried in hours of podcasts, lectures, and interviews. Finding a specific topic means endless manual scrubbing, guessing timestamps, and wasting time. This "information overload" makes your media library a black box‚Äîfull of content, but devoid of accessible knowledge.

## The Solution: Your Media, Instantly Intelligible

Citeio solves this by creating a "semantic index" of your content. It automatically processes media to understand *what* is being said and *when*. It identifies distinct topics, generates summaries, and allows you to search your entire library by concept or idea, not just by matching keywords.

-----

## ‚ñ∫ Core Features

* **üéôÔ∏è Automated Ingestion & Transcription:**

  * Seamlessly ingest media from sources like YouTube or direct uploads.
  * Standardize all content into a high-quality audio format for optimal analysis.
  * Generate precise, time-coded transcripts for every piece of media.

* **üß† AI-Powered Content Intelligence:**

  * Leverage advanced language models to automatically identify and segment distinct thematic topics within a single file.
  * Receive concise, AI-generated summaries for both the entire media file and for each individual topic.

* **üîç Powerful Semantic Search:**

  * Go beyond keyword search. Find what you're looking for based on concepts and ideas.
  * Query your library with natural language (e.g., "when did they discuss market strategy?") and get back the exact, timestamped segment.

* **‚öôÔ∏è Developer-First RESTful API:**

  * Integrate Citeio's capabilities into your own applications. A comprehensive API exposes all core functionalities, from ingestion to search.

## ‚ñ∫ How It Works: The Analysis Pipeline

The platform uses a sophisticated, automated pipeline designed for scalability and efficiency.

## ‚ñ∫ Project Status & Roadmap

**Current Status:** Citeio is **Live and Operational**. The core platform for media analysis and semantic search is stable and available at [Citeio.com](https://citeio.com).

**What's Next:** Our roadmap is focused on expanding data sources and deepening analytical capabilities.

* **ü§ñ Advanced Search & Interaction:**

  * **Chat with Media:** Go beyond search and engage in a conversation with your video content to ask follow-up questions and explore topics dynamically.
  * **Hybrid Search & Reranking:** Implement advanced search techniques combining keyword and semantic matching, with a reranking layer to deliver hyper-relevant results.
  * **Contextual Summaries:** Move from simple clip retrieval to providing AI-generated summaries and analysis based on the context of your search query.

* **üåê Expanding Data Sources:**

  * **X (Twitter) Spaces:** Ingest and analyze live and recorded audio conversations from X Spaces.
  * **Vimeo Integration:** Broaden support for professional video content hosted on Vimeo.
